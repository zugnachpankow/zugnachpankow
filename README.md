# Hi there, I'm Max   ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **PhD student** in the [Earth Resilience Science Unit (ERSU)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de) at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), supervised by **Ricarda Winkelmann** and **Jonathan Donges**.  

My work focuses on **developing and quantifying metrics for (World-)Earth system resilience**, using pathwise and information-based approaches.  

This page links to some (ongoing) coding work and the corresponding repositories.
